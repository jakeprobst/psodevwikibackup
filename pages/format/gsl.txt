====== GSL Archive Format ======


GSL is a 2KiB-block aligned file archive format. It has appeared in all versions of Phantasy Star Online and in Phantasy Star Universe. Unlike [[:format:afs|AFS]], GSL includes a file metadata table in its header.

Archives may be big endian or little endian, but there is no indication as to which -- however there is a heuristic that can detect the endianness of most GSL archives. GSLs found on the Gamecube are big endian, while Blue Burst uses little endian.

===== Overview =====

GSL archives are split in 2KiB (2048-byte) blocks, and a section may only start at the beginning of a block. There is a header section, followed by file sections.

The archive header is simply an array of file headers.

<code c>
struct fileheader_s {
    uint8_t filename[32]; // ASCII filename, does not have to be null-terminated
    uint32_t offset; // offset in blocks
    uint32_t size; // size in bytes
    uint8_t _unused[8];
};
</code>

The end of the header list is either the first entry in the header blocks that has a filename starting with a null byte, or the first block of a file, whichever comes first.

===== Guessing the endianness =====

The values of ''offset'' and ''size'' will be stored in the endianness of the target client. If you do not know the endianness already, you will have to guess it. A simple algorithm to do so:

  - Get the size of the full archive and divide it by 2048 to get the number of blocks in the file.
  - When reading the offset and size of a file header, first read them as big endian.
  - If the offset is greater than the number of blocks, then the archive is little endian instead; restart parsing of the archive from the beginning and read as little endian.

Since this is merely a heuristic, it may fail under certain malformed archives, but it should not fail if the archive is packed reasonably.

===== File contents =====

A file's data starts at its ''offset * 2048'' bytes from the start of the archive and ends at ''offset * 2048 + size''.

===== Format caveats =====

Files have a maximum size of 4 GiB, although the expected storage medium for which the format was created for was CD-ROMs on the SEGA Saturn. With that said, the offset can account for archives up to //8 TiB// in size.
